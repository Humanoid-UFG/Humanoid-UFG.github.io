            <p class="pharagraph">The Talos team was founded by members of the Pequi Mecânico Robotics Group and engineering students from the Federal University of Goiás, with the purpose of researching, developing, and training students in humanoid robotics. The motivation to compete in humanoid robot soccer stems from the interest of experienced members in the field, while also serving as an engaging and accessible entry point for newcomers.<br><br>
            Focusing on the study, research, and development of software for autonomous humanoid robots, the team employs the Booster Humanoid T1 as its primary development platform. The work encompasses topics ranging from the safe operation of humanoid robots to autonomous behavior and decision-making, motion execution, computer vision and audio-based interaction.
